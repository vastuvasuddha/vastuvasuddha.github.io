								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p>Vastu Shastra is one of the ancient teachings from the Indian civilization. It deals with the science of the architecture and tells how a building should be planned to channelize the positive energy in our lives. The proper implementation of Vastu techniques has brought peace and prosperity to many households for centuries. Though Vastu started out with the construction rules for Hindu temples, it soon branched out to residential houses, office buildings, vehicles, sculpture, paintings, furniture etc. The science of Vastu is mostly based on directions and the building materials used, along with many other minor factors.</p>
<h3>The history of Vastu</h3>
<p>The Indian civilization is the oldest in the world and has a rich heritage of developing different branches of science. Vastu Shastra is one such discipline that developed over the years based on the traditional knowledge gained from studying the
nature. The age old Indian philosophers knew a lot about the five elements that made the universe.</p>
<p>They also had knowledge about the gravitational field, magnetic field, the position of the earth, velocity of the winds, ultraviolet rays, the intensity and volume of rainfall etc. Application of this knowledge certainly made sure that the
construction of the house was scientific and spiritual at the same time. This is knowledge that people have garnered through years and years of study and test as well.</p>
